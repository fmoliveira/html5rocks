# Master redirects file for html5rocks.com. This is similar to, but with subtle differences from,
# the format used in DevSite and web.dev.
#
# There are two redirect methods to redirect URLs:
#  (1) This file (strongly preferred).
#  (2) Adding a redirect URL to the article metadata in the database.
#      See "-DBRedirect-" in main.py for the code that handles that redirect.
#
#  (1) Simple redirects, e.g., "from: /foo"
#      - These don't match subpaths, like "/foo/bar"
#      - But it will match similar URLs "/foo", "/foo/" and "/foo/index.html"
#
#  (2) Group redirects, e.g., "from: /foo/...", which will match the top-level path (with the same
#      same rules as (1)) as well as any descendant paths
#      - The 'to' rule can optionally end with "/..." to bring across the suffix, or it can be left
#        off to drop this part.
#
# Differences from other redirect files:
#
#   * IMPORTANT! These redirects TAKE PRIORITY over contents.
#   * If a redirect is added from "/tutorials/", then the content page at this location will never
#     appear. The redirect will catch "/tutorials", "/tutorials/", as well as
#     "/tutorials/index.html".
#   * Redirects are also applied AFTER language is run: the above example will ALSO match any
#     valid language, e.g. "/en/tutorials/". If this match occurs, the same language prefix will
#     be applied when the redirect is within the site (the "to:" starts with a slash).
#     - If a rule says "/tutorials/" => "/banana/", then "/en/tutorials/" will go to "/en/banana/".
#     - This won't be included when going to another domain
#
